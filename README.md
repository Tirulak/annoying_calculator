## The calculator horror 



# Basic functions:

    1) addition (hysterical)
    2) substraction (i will let you guess about it)
    2) division (annoying)
    3) multiplication (basic. nothing else... ;))
    4) full division (a REAL FULL DIVISION)
    5) power (If you want still a working computer don't run this one)

# More to come!
    For example:
        1) UI (Tkinter probably)
        2) Jumpscare window!
        3) Annoying 'boop' sound when clicking a button
        4) Horrific messages!
